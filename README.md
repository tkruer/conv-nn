A basic Convolutional Neural Network in Rust from scratch

## Overview

This is a basic implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Rust specifically for the [MNIST dataset](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). For one of my grad classes, we had to implement a CNN from scratch in Python, which was a fun exercise but incredibly slow. I thought it would be a fun challenge to implement one in Rust. The goal of this project is to not abstract away any of the underlying math and concepts with libraries where reasonable. While it's not optimized at this point in time, I plan to implement some optimizations in the future.
